# Example Package
Example package is a package that is used to demonstrate an implementation of a package using the Quantom framework for game development on the ROBLOX platform. It features two methods: 
```lua
local Example = Quantom:GetModule("Example")
Example:Print("Hello world")
```
This, will just print a line of code. However, this isn't the *only* thing. This also has (drum-roll please)... A `PrintRandom` method!
This is fairly straight-forward, and just prints a random word.
```lua
Example:PrintRandom() -- :o
```
Amazing, right?
